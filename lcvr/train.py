  Args:
    reader: A class which parses the training data.
    data_pattern: A 'glob' style path to the data files.
    batch_size: How many examples to process at a time.
    num_epochs: How many passes to make over the training data. Set to 'None'

    num_readers: How many I/O threads to use.

  Returns:

    depend on the reader being used.
